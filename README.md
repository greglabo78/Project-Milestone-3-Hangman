# THE Hangman Game
## Introduction
The game is a simple terminal game implemented in Python. Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging stick figure is displayed. The player wins if they guess the word correctly before the stick figure is completely drawn.

The game is targeted at word games lovers to have a simple word game session in python.
